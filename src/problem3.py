# Done: 2.
#   In this problem, you will go through the methods of the  Person  class
#   that is defined below, one by one, in the order that they appear.
#   For each method:
#      (a) Read the method's doc-string (i.e., specification in double-quotes).
#            If you do not understand WHAT the method is to do,
#            ask your instructor to clarify it.
#      (b) Implement the method.
#      (c) Write whatever code you want in  main  to test your code.
#            We wrote SOME testing code in  main  just to get you started.

    # Here is some simple code for testing a small part of the  Person  class:
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # Test get_age:
    p1 = Person(9)
    print(p1.age)   # for init
    print(p1.get_age())  # Should print 9
    p1.celebrate_birthday()
    print('Age after birthday:', p1.get_age())
    print('Age should be 10')
    p1.celebrate_birthdays(10)
    print('Age after 10 birthdays:', p1.get_age())
    print('Age should be 20')
    p2 = p1.older_person()
    print('Old persons age:', p2.get_age())
    print('Old persons age should have returned 40')

    #   in the  Person  class.  You are graded only on your implementation of
    #   the  Person  class, NOT on the quality or quantity of these tests
    #   that you write here. So KEEP IT SIMPLE here in main.
